#Variables

There are 88 total variables. The first two, "subjects" and "activities" are grouped and summarized. 
"Subjects" identifies the 30 participants in the study with an integer from 1 to 30.
"Activities" are what activities were measured for the study: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying.

The remaining 86 variables are descriptive and detail what it is they measure. For instance, "body.acceleration.time.mean.x" measures the mean of the body's acceleration time across the X axis.

#Summaries
The data is summarized in groups of subjects and activities.

Subjects - There were 30 subjects for this study identified with integers from 1 to 30.

Activities - All 30 subjects were monitored doing the following six activities:

Walking

Walking downstairs
Sitting
Standing
Laying

The mean of the remaining 86 variables is calculated for each subject doing each activity.

Units

Time, frequency and magnitude measurements were made.
Time was measured in
